<h1>stupidity</h1>

<p>i love stupidity</p>

<h1>Did you know that you can easily learn to be stupid?</h1>

<p>
there are a lot of ways that you can learn to be stupidthere are different ways wi
th which you can be stupid. there are a lot of kinds ofstupidity. for example, th-
ere are those who really are stupid. They are people who are doing things whithout
using their brains. Many prople have often met those "Creatures"  as their behavi-
our is just inhuman or according to my VERBOGENESIS hyperhuman. If you think that 
you belong to this type, then you should really look for mental and psycholoical h-
elp. If you think that you belong here, then click <a href="mental_help.html">YES</a>
